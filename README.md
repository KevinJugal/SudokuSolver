Solving sudoku using CSP

CSP = (X, D, C) 

X = Set of variables – 9x9 grid (81 cells)<br> 
D = Set of domains – possible values for the variables  
C = Set of constraints – Restrict which values can be places on the variable (cell) 

This means Sudoku can be used as a constraint satisfaction problem.
